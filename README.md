# Test website for using Stencil with Vanilla TypeScript

This project is part of my bachelor thesis with the topic of defining the best suited web technology for implementing a company intern component library as part of a design system. In order to do so, three component library prototypes are implemented along with test websites to use the implemented components. 

Here is an overview of the software parts of this bachelor thesis:

This project represents the **Vanilla TS test website based on Stencil** to test importing the Stencil component library prototype to a framework-less project based on only TypeScript and webpack.

The links to all the parts of the bachelor thesis are listed below.

## Serve website

Run `npm start` to build the website with webpack. If you have installed the "Five Server" extension for your IDE (in case of VS Code: Live Server (Five Server)) you can start a dev server by clicking on the `index.html` file in the `public` directory. The website is then served locally on `http://localhost:5555/`.
